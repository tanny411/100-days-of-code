### Day 4: September 5, 2019
**Today's Progress**: 
- Learned manachers algorithm from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbTSfrEfo6M)
- Solved from Leetcode
	- longest palindromic substring with manachers algo. Quite an algorithm. Simple and amazing!
	- zigzag conversion
	- reverse integer*
	- srtring to integer(atoi)*
	- Palindromic Number*
*these problems have interesting check for integer overflow, may need to revisit.
